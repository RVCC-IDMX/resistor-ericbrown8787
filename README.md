# Resistor Calculator

This tool calculates the resistance values(in Ohms Î©) of ceramic resistors based on their color codes.  


## Usage

Resistor bands are read from left to right, with the tolerance band(the band apart from the first three) being on the right.

### To calculate the value of a resistor: 

1. Starting with band 1(the leftmost band), click the color button corresponding to your resistor's band in each of the four band selection fields.

2. The currently selected color will display next to each band's heading in the band selection interface, and the band on the resistor diagram will change to reflect the current selection.

3. Once all colors have been selected and you have confirmed that they match the ones on your resistor, the formatted resistance value based on the current selections may be read underneath the resistor diagram.
